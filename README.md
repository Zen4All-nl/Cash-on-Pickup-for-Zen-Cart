# Zen-Cart-Cash-on-Pickup

## Description
This module allows you to accept cash on pickup when a customer elects to use the 'Walk in' option at checkout. The option will not display when a customer elects another shipping method.

## Instructions
Just unzip this into the includes folder of your zen cart. This will not replace any files under a standard installation.

Setup is done via the zen cart admin -> modules -> payments.

## NOTE
this module was 'built' from the cod module, lending heavily. I thought I would share as I have seen a few questions around forums about how to do this.

## Change log

inlcludes/modules/payment/cop.php:

Updated the code to make the module work with the current Zen Cart version (1.5.4), previous versions, and probably future versions as well.
